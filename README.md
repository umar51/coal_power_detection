# üè≠ Coal Plant Predictions 



This model uses satellite data to predict if a coal plant is turned on and producing carbon emissions. The satellite data comes from [Google Earth Engine.](https://earthengine.google.com/)

* **Model**: 1D Fully Convolutional Network in [TensorFlow]
* **Creating datasets**: [Sentinel-2] satellite data from [Earth Engine]
* **Training the model**: [TensorFlow] in [Vertex AI]
* **Getting predictions**: [TensorFlow] in [Cloud Run]
